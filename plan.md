# Financial Analyzer 

The goal: 

The goal is to build a financial analyzer that evaluates any stock, compares it comprehensively with the companies in the portfolio, and provides a clear recommendation on whether to buy the analyzed stock or expand an existing position, based on quantitative data. It does this by:

1. Collecting data from Simply Wall Street and Yahoo Finance on the stock and the companies in the portfolio.
2. Storing the data in a database
3. Performing relevant pre-processing on the data
4. Passing the data to the OpenAI API for analysis
5. Returning the analysis to the user
